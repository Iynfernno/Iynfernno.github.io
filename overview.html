                    When a team signs a player to play for them they must negotiate a contract that 
                    says how long the player will play and how much they will be paid but, there is 
                    another part to the contract. They can also negotiate to have a buyout on that player
                    meaning that if both teams and the player agree then another team could buy the player
                    to have them play on their team instead. (Source 2)

                    Over the course of the LCS the money teams are willing to spend on their players and
                    staff has been consistenty rising, to the point where teams are spending 11+ million
                    dollars just for a player to play on their team for one year. This massive spending
                    can be seen as a good thing for the LCS because it is showing its growth over the 
                    past couple years however, this could be hinting at the league's biggest dip in 
                    viewership it has seen to date.

                        During the 2020 and 2021 season many people started to believe that the inflated 
                        money spending is just a bubble and would soon pop. It turns out that, that was 
                        partially correct, during the 2021 off season fans watched as their favorite players 
                        failed to find a new team because they were stuck behind a massive buyout that 
                        other teams didn't want to pay.

                        This situation didn't just happen overnight, it all starts back in the 2020 offseason 
                        when the big 3 NA teams (Cloud9, Team Liquid, and TSM) spent large to import the best 
                        players they could from around the world. Those players being Perkz, Alphari, and 
                        Swordart. All with the hopes of being able to prefor better internationally
                        than in past years

                    The first team in the big three to be elimanated was TSM who did not place
                    top three during the summer 2021 season, making them unable to qualify to play
                    at worlds - the biggest Esport event ever with a peak viewership of over 4 million.

                    Team Liquid had a decent peformance in the groups stange during worlds but was unable
                    to make quarterfinals which while the team hoped to go farther that was their more
                    realistic goal.

                <h2 style="text-align: center; padding: 0 0 2vh 0;">
                    Finally was C9 who after being put into the hardest group possible
                    was able to make an upset and managed to make it out and into the quarterfinals
                    which maked the first time a team from North America made it into quarterfinals.
                    Unfortunately they were then eliminated from the tournament

                    Overall North America and Europe did not have an awful year internationally but 
                    the communities opinion on spending big to find the best players possible was 
                    quickly changing this lead to many teams focusing more on player development 
                    over the next few years. As teams began rearagning their rosters for the 2022
                    season many big name players would not be able to find a team due to other teams
                    not willing to spend money on the large buyouts tied to their contracts.
