                    When a team signs a player to play for them they must negotiate a contract that 
                    says how long the player will play and how much they will be paid but, there is 
                    another part to the contract. They can also negotiate to have a buyout on that player
                    meaning that if both teams and the player agree then another team could buy the player
                    to have them play on their team instead. (Source 2)

                    Over the course of the LCS the money teams are willing to spend on their players and
                    staff has been consistenty rising, to the point where teams are spending 11+ million
                    dollars just for a player to play on their team for one year. This massive spending
                    can be seen as a good thing for the LCS because it is showing its growth over the 
                    past couple years however, this could be hinting at the league's biggest dip in 
                    viewership it has seen to date.

            <h2>
                During the 2020 and 2021
                season many people started to believe that the inflated money spending is just a bubble
                and would soon pop. It turns out that, that was partially correct, during the 2021
                off season fans watched as their favorite players failed to find a new team because
                they were suck behind a missive buyout that other teams didn't want to pay.
