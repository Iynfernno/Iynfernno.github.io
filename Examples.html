                        Kelby May who used to be an agent that helped LCS players sign and create their 
                        contracts has made it clear that the contracts players agree to and sign goes 
                        through many different people to make sure that it is benificial for both parties
                        and every player knows what their buyout is and how it can effect them. Meaning
                        that many people throughout the scene beleive that the players unable to find a team
                        during the offseason should not be complaining because the signed the contract knowing
                        its terms. (Source 3)
